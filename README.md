# 📚 Library Management System (LMS)

A lightweight desktop-based Library Management System designed to streamline book tracking, user authentication, and basic library operations. Built as a prototype suitable for small libraries transitioning from manual record-keeping.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Secure Login System**  
  Basic authentication with masked password input.

- 🖥 **Clean WinForms UI**  
  Structured interface with anchored controls for a smooth user experience.
